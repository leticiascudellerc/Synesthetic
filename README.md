# 🎧 Synesthetic

**Synesthetic** is a mood-driven music discovery app that merges **emotion, color, and sound**.  
Pick how you feel — and your favorite genre — and the interface transforms in real-time while curated Spotify playlists appear to match your vibe.

## 🪄 Overview

Synesthetic bridges art and data through an interactive experience that visualizes sound.  
It uses the **Spotify Web API** to fetch playlists that align with a user’s selected *mood* and *genre*, dynamically adapting the UI colors and background animations to reflect that energy.  
Every playlist expands to preview tracks — blending emotional design with practical data querying.

This project was designed, coded, and deployed by **Letícia Scudeller**, a BUCS (Business + Computer Science) student at UBC passionate about creative tech and AI-powered interfaces.
